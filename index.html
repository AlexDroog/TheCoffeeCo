                        <p>A word from our founder and consumers</p>
                       
              

                    <blockquote><p>"I truly believe that The Coffee Co. is doing something different from its competitors. When faced with the giants like Tim Horton's or McDonalds, customers keep coming back and it is for a reason. We meticulously craft each cup of coffee to our standards of perfection and in that way I think the customers know the difference in quality between fast and good. Thats why I love our customers, its why I love The Coffee Co."<br><br> John Smith - The Coffee Co. Founder</p></blockquote>
                    <br>
                    <blockquote><p>"I love the Coffee Co. Its honestly my favorite place to grab a coffee. They have a very nice interior aesthetic and its always so warm, cozy and inviting"<br><br> Jane Doe - Frequent Customer</p></blockquote>
                    <br>           
                    <blockquote><p>"I've had a lot of coffee from a lot of different coffee shops before and nothing is quite like their coffee. Its made just the way you like it every single time without failure. Its simply the best you can buy."<br><br> John Doe - Frequent Customer</p></blockquote>
